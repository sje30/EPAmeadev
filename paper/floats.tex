rough ordering of observations by DIV is apparent in the red to purple

PCA. Compared to the well-level PCA scree plot, a larger amount of
variation is captured in the first two PC dimensions indicating that
well averaging reduces variability.

  		\hline
  		Feature & Description
  		\\ \hline 
  		Mean firing Rate & The mean firing rate (MFR) on each electrode was calculated. The well value was the median value of all active electrodes. 
  		\\ Burst rate  & The number of bursts per minute on an electrode was calculated. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour. 
  		\\ Burst duration  & The mean duration of all bursts on an electrode over the recording period was calculated. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour.
  		\\ Fraction of bursting electrodes  & An electrode was classified as bursting if the burst rate on the electrode was at least one per minute. The well value was the number of electrodes classified as bursting as a fraction of the total number of active electrodes on the well.  
  		\\ Within burst firing rate   & The electrode value was the mean firing rate within all bursts on the electrode. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour. 
  		\\ Percentage of spikes in bursts & The number of spikes on an electrode classified as being within bursts divided by the total number of spikes on the electrode. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour.  
  		\\ CV of IBI & The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the length of all inter-burst intervals (IBI) on an electrode. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour.  
  		\\ CV of within burst ISIs &  The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the length of all inter-spike intervals (ISI) within bursts on an electrode. The well value was the median value from all electrodes that exhibited bursting behaviour.  
  		\\ Network spike rate &  The well value was the number of network spikes on the well per minute of the recording period (See Methods section for definition of a Network Spike).
  		\\ Network spike duration  & The duration of a network spike was defined as the length of time during which the number of active electrodes on the well exceeded the threshold value (5). The well value was taken as the median duration of all network spikes on the well during the recording period.
  		\\ Network spike peak  & The maximum number of active electrodes during each network spike. The well value was taken as the median peak value of all network spikes on the well during the recording period. 
  		\\ Mean correlation & The correlation between every pairwise combination of electrodes on a well was calculated using the spike time tiling coefficient (Cutts \& Eglen, 2015) with $\Delta t = 50ms$. (See Methods section for definition). The well value was the mean of the pairwise correlations between all distinct electrodes on the well.
